                    <li>Added spatial positioning to all sound effects.</li>
                    <li>Added sound effects to the Goblin Underling and Goblin Archer's attacks.</li>
                    <li>Added sound effects to the windmill fan on The Farm.</li>

                    <li>Reduced audio latency.</li>
                    <li>Performance improvements.</li>
                    <li>Improved loading times.</li>
                    <li>Removed the ability to toggle shadows.</li>
                    <li>Prevented overlapping of equipment on the character.</li>
                    <li>Added a splash screen with a loading bar, a fullscreen button, copyright info, and its own soundtrack.</li>
                    <li>The player no longer has to stop moving when equipping and unequipping items.</li>
                    <li>Added a fade-in/fade-out effect when transition between screens/areas.</li>
                    <li>The audio fades in and out between screens/areas as well.</li>

                    <li>Items are opaque while clicking and dragging them, to better see exactly where they'll be dropped.</li>

                </ul>

                    <li>High memory consumption when transitioning between very large areas.</li>
                    <li>Some parts of the UI could be interacted with while on the loading screen for Windmill Level 1.</li>
